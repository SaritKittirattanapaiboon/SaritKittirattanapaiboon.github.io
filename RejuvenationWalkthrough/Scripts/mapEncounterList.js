                    Shuckle is best known for having the highest defenses of all the Pokemon, and practically 0 stats elsewhere. Because of its base 20 HP, it doesn't even function particularly well as a tank, and so it will have difficulty doing much of anything. If you catch it and save it though, at level 45 it can learn Power Split and Guard Split, which can be used to effectively negate the opponenet's offensive stat or boost your Pokemon's defensive stats. Before then though, best it can try for is Power Trick at level 31 to swap is Defense with its Attack and try to do damage with Rock Throw, or Rock Slide/Bug Bite at levels 38 and 42 respectively.

                    Pidgey will evolve into Pidgeotto, which at this point is relatively decent. With one evoltion under its belt, it provides a decent advantage over unevolved Pokemon. However, it still suffers from movepool issues as it won't have any strong moves to use other than from TMs. As a Pidgeot, it's still fast with lackluster offensive stats, and most of its preferred moves are learned all the way in the level 60's. It can still be used if you need a Flying type in the early game, but it may not be the most useful past that.

                    <span class="wildPokemonTooltip">
                    Pineco is a very physically defensive Pokemon, but at this point it doesn't have the movepool to help it succeed. If you're lucky, it can still have Self-Destruct, which allows it to deal massive damage before it faints. If you want, you can catch one then wait until level 31 when it evolves into a Forretress, where it gains the Steel-type and a whole lot of resistances. Here, it will finally learn entry hazard moves and be able to function as a suicide lead well.

                    Crabrawler has a very high Attack stat for a first-stage Pokemon, and also has decent Speed and physical bulk. It also learns Rock Smash naturally, along with Pursuit and Dizzy Punch for good neutral coverage and Power-Up Punch to boost its Attack stat even more. Even as it levels up, it gains good moves in Payback due to its low Speed, and Crabhammer. Its main drawback is its evolution timing, as it can only evolve into Crabominable in certain places, the earliest of which is at the near the the seventh badge. While Crabominable is definitely worth it, other Fighting-type Pokemon will be available then that has a lot of immediate power compared to Crabrawler.

                    Aipom has a high Attack and Speed stat, but doesn't quite have the movepool to take full advantage of its stats. What it does have is a very large TM movepool, allowing it to learn a new move almost everytime a new TM is picked up. One of its advantages is learning Baton Pass naturally, and in the late stages of the game it can function very well as a support Baton Pass for special attackers, being able to learn both Agility and Nasty Plot. However, that is very late into the game in the level 30's, and it will evolve into Ambipom at level 33 at the earliest when it learns Double Hit. It may be more practical to catch an Aipom and wait until the level limit is high enough to take full advantage.

                    #412 Burmy
                    <span class="wildPokemonTooltip">
                    Burmy will evolve into either Mothim or Wormadam depending on its gender, and each of those two serve different purposes, especially the different forms of Wormadam. Before you read all of this though, generally speaking they are not very worthwhile Pokemon to use in the long term.
                    <br><br>
                    As Mothim, it will immediately learn Quiver Dance on evolving, making it a very formidable threat stat-wise. In terms of movepool, it will have Hidden Power if it evolved at level 20, Confusion at level 23, and Gust at 26. All relatively weak moves, but can work if Mothim is boosted enough. It won't learn any strong moves until way later, so Mothim will be reliant on TMs to keep its movepool strong enough.
                    <br><br>
                    As Wormadam, the Pokemon will be much more bulky than its counterpart, although how bulky exactly depends on its form. The common point though is that all three forms are very, very slow. In its Plant-Cloak form, most of its stats are in the special side, having very high Special Defense and good Special Attack. It's Bug/Grass typing makes it have large advantages against certain Pokemon, but is also very disadvantaged against any Fire-type or Flying-type coverage. In Sandy-Cloak form, its typing is much more neutral as Ground-type counteracts a lot of Bug-type weaknesses. It's stats in this form are shifted to be more physical, with high Defense and good Attack. Finally, the Trash-Cloak form gives it a lot of resistances from its additional Steel-type, but still makes it very weak to Fire. It's stats here are evenly spread, with equally good Defense and Special Defense, and low damage stats across both physical and special. All forms movepool is largely the same, as all forms get a few Psychic-type moves such as Psybeam, but every form gets one or two of its secondary type such as Razor Leaf, Rock Blast, or Mirror Shot.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, which one you get is largely dependant on your luck, as Burmy is already at a very low find rate on a non-guarenteed Headbutt, then there's gender chances and form chances into play. Both Mothim and Wormadam are typically not worth the amount of thought needed to use them correctly, speaking overall.

Its stats are still pretty poor though, so even with powerful moves it may be doing much less damage than expected.

It can also have the very useful ability Dry Skin to take advantage of switch ins, or Solar Power to hit much harder in the sun. On the other hand, its movepool is very poor, having only Thundershock until level 25 where it learns Parabolic Charge. It also evolves with the Sun Stone, which you can get at the earliest after the fourth gym. All these factors mean that Helioptile will work out in the early game, but won't carry its own weight much in the midgame until you come across a Sun Stone.

Depending on luck, a Shiny Stone before the second gym is also possible, but you might need to save and reset the game a few times before the Shiny Stone is obtained.

However, if you reset for a female Shinx, you can breed the elemental fang moves (Fire Fang and Ice Fang) onto it. Arbok is a potential parent who can learn both of the fang moves, and even Thunder Fang if you want it earlier.

If you save and reload, you can also get yourself a female Eevee and breed it. Every evolution if Eevee is useable, though some or more versatile than others. Most Eeveelutions suffer a little from lack of coverage, though some can learn moves of a similar type. Here's a breakdown of how each Eeveelution can be used:
        <br><br>
        Tank: Vaporeon and Umbreon have very high Special Defense. Vaporeon invests more into its HP pool, while Umbreon has much higher Defense than Vaporeon. Vaporeon can also offer good damage output with good Special Attack and also be your Surfer if you need one, and it can also learn Ice-type coverage. Umbreon learns Moonlight, which can really help its staying power against a lot of threats, though its offensive presence is lacking.
        <br><br>
        Physical Damage: Flareon and Leafeon are very powerful physical Attackers, but you can't get Leafeon until later. Flareon is slower, but has higher Attack has a lot of Special bulk, while Leafeon is faster, is physically defensive, and is slightly weaker offensively. Both suffer from lack of coverage, with with naturally only learning Normal-type and their respective-type moves, and even with TMs their options are limited. But, for their types, they are very powerful physical Attackers, and their early moves aren't too bad. Flareon will get Fire Fang if you evolve it before level 20, and Leafeon will get Razor Leaf on evolution and, at the point where you can get Leafeon, Leaf Blade soon.
        <br><br>
        Special Damage: Espeon and Jolteon are the special counterparts to Flareon and Leafeon. Jolteon is the fastest of the bunch, but it also has the worst movepool of the three. It will learn the very weak Thunder Shock when it evolves, but it won't get another Special Electric-type move until Thunder at level 45. It also has virtually no coverage, with Hidden Power and some Normal-type moves being its only options. Espeon has the higher Special Attack, with Espeon being faster and Glaceon being bulkier. Espeon can learn Psybeam at level 20, which is a fine move for this point in the game and it'll get Psychic at level 37.
        <br><br>
        Flexible: Sylveon and Glaceon are very flexible in their roles. Sylveon has similar stats to Espeon, but its movepool of Misty Terrain and Light Screen makes it very easy to be a supportive tank rather than an offensive threat. It can still go on the offensive with moves such as Moonblast at level 37, though its stuck with just Fairy Wind before then. You can't get Glaceon for a long time, but once you do it is very bulky both physically and specially, and can even boost its physical Defense even more with Barrier and be annoying with Hail and Substitude. It can also give Speed control to its team with Icy Wind, or go offensive with Hail and Blizzard way later in the game.`],
