    [ ["Rockruff is a strong physical attacker, even unevolved. It will learn Rock Throw at level 15, which is a serviceable STAB move, and it learns Bite even earlier for coverage. If needed it can also have Howl to boost its attack even more. The Rockruffs you catch can evolve into either Lycanroc Day form or Night form, and if you want the Dusk form then we can trade our Rockruff for an Own Tempo Rockruff at Oceana Pier. All three forms are viable throughout the game, and they serve different purposes. Night Form Lycanroc is the slowest and tankiest, and there's not much difference between the stats of the Day Form and Dusk Form. For Abilities, Day Form gets access to Steadfast, which is mediocre. Dusk Form gets No Guard, which allows it to guarentee Stone Edge hits. Dusk Form gets Tough Claws, which boosts its contact moves. This is one of the best and most reliable Pokemon you can get, so its worth the consideration."], ], //Rockruff

    [ ["Fomantis' stats are generally very middling, and its speed is very low. It does learn Growth which can boost its Attack and Special Attack, and learns Razor Leaf very early to take advantage of some Double Battles that are coming up. It can also learn Leaf Blade at level 23, which is just after the first gym. If you're lucky, it can also have the ability Contrary, which lets your stats get boosted rather than lowered. The biggest downside to Fomantis is that it evolves at level 34, which is a long time to be stuck with a poor-stated Pokemon like Fomantis. But for the first little while, it is a perfectly serviceable Grass type."], ], //Fomantis
